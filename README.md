# Functions practice
This repo should be used in conjunction with CS class and the [Functions handout](https://github.com/maleich/CS-lesson-plans/blob/master/Functions.md) here and in OneNote.

## Problem Description
There are a few different files to modify/use in this repo. Please read the instructions carefully. 
1) Calling functions:
  - Predictions:
    - Read the code [call_functions_predict.py](call_functions_predict.py). Predict the output and write your prediction in the comment area at the end of the program.
    - Run the program and check your predictions. If you were incorrect, be sure you can figure out why.
  - Editing:
    - Open the code [call_functions_edit.py](call_functions_edit.py). Rearrange the function calls so the output is in a logical order.
    - Define a new function that tells the user a joke (you decide on the function name and the joke). Call it in a sensible place in the program. Remember that function definitions go at the top of the program, so place your function in an appropriate location.
2) Returns
  - Experiment with [adder.py](adder.py) as much as you want, especially arguments and indentations.
  - Open [return_practice.py](return_practice.py) and read it carefully. Then add your predictions at the bottom of the program.
  - Open [multiplier.py](multiplier.py). Adapt the code from one of the functions above to create a new function called 'multiplier'.
    - The user should be able to input two numbers that are stored in variables.
    - The function should multiply the two variables together and return the result to a variable in the main program.
    - The main program should output the variable containing the result returned from the function.
3) Parameters & Arguments
  - Open [add5.py](add5.py) and play with the function calls at the end. 
    - Change the argument in line 4 and run the program. What happens?
    - Comment out line 4 and uncomment lines 6 & 7. Run the program again. What happens?
    - Look at line 8. Try it instead of the other function calls. Can you see how it does the same thing? (You are not required to use the condensed version, but you should be able to read it.)
4) Assignment: Open [calculator.py](calculator.py).
  - Define four functions - add, subtract, multiply, divide that add (or multiply etc) two numbers and return the result. Each should have two integer number arguments.
  - The user is asked to input two numbers. These numbers will be passed as arguments into one of the functions.
  - The user is asked to input 1 to add, 2 to subtract etc. If they input 1, call the ‘add’ function, input 2 calls the ‘subtract’ function etc.
  - Output the returned result as part of a sentence.
